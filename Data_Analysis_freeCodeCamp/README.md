# Data Analysis with Python `freeCodeCamp`

[`Data Analysis`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. By the end of this certification, you'll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.

# [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)
In these comprehensive video courses, created by Santiago Basulto, you will learn the whole process of data analysis. You'll be reading data from multiple sources (CSV, SQL, Excel), process that data using NumPy and Pandas, and visualize it using Matplotlib and Seaborn,

Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook course, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

# Numpy
Learn the basics of the NumPy library in the following video course created by Keith Galli.

In this course, you'll learn how NumPy works and how it compares to Python's built-in lists. You'll also learn how to write code with NumPy, indexing, reshaping, applied statistics, and much more.
